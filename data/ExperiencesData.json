We get our families together and eat the same thing as at Christmas: sill (marinated fish), gravad salmon, meatballs ... We dress a pole with flowers and leafs and dance around it, but that is mostly for the children."},
        {"headline":"Swedish Christmas", "country":"Sweden", "message": "In Sweden we celebrate Christmas like many other countries but with some differences. We celebrate Christmas one day before all other countries, the 24th. No one knows why but that's the way it is. We eat traditional Swedish food, the same as we eat for easter and midsommarafton including graved salmon, sill, meat balls and much more. It is one of the few times many sweds actually gather the whole family to spend some time together. And no one misses the Donald Duck movie that is shown every year at the television. It is a tradition."},
